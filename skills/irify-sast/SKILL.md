# IRify SAST

Deep static analysis skill powered by IRify's SSA compiler and SyntaxFlow query engine.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the yaklang MCP server. Configure it in your agent's MCP settings:

```toml
# Codex: ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.yaklang-ssa]
command = "yak"
args = ["mcp", "-t", "ssa"]
```

```json
// Claude Code / Cursor / others
{ "command": "yak", "args": ["mcp", "-t", "ssa"] }
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Compile (once per project, auto-cached)

```
ssa_compile(target="/path/to/project", language="java", program_name="MyProject")
→ full compilation, returns program_name
```

**Auto Cache**: If the program was already compiled and source files haven't changed, the engine returns `[Cache Hit]` instantly (milliseconds) — no recompilation happens. Always provide a `program_name` to enable caching.

### Step 2: Query (unlimited, no recompile needed)

```
ssa_query(program_name="MyProject", rule="<SyntaxFlow rule>")
```

### Step 3: Code Changed — Incremental Compile

```
ssa_compile(target="/path/to/project", language="java", base_program_name="MyProject")
→ only changed files recompiled, ProgramOverLay merges base + diff layers
→ returns NEW program_name for subsequent queries
```

**IMPORTANT**: Use `base_program_name` for incremental compilation. `re_compile=true` is a full recompile that discards all data — only use it to start completely fresh.

### Step 4: Self-Healing Query (auto-retry on syntax error)

When `ssa_query` returns a SyntaxFlow parsing error:
1. **DO NOT** apologize to the user or ask for help
2. Read the error message carefully — it contains the exact parse error position and expected tokens
3. Fix the SyntaxFlow rule based on the error
4. Re-invoke `ssa_query` with the corrected rule
5. Repeat up to **3 times** before reporting failure to the user
6. If all retries fail, show the user: the original rule, each attempted fix, and the final error

This is critical — SyntaxFlow has strict syntax and minor mistakes (missing semicolons, wrong operator) are common. The agent should self-correct silently.

## Critical: Follow User Intent

**DO NOT** automatically construct source→sink vulnerability rules unless the user explicitly asks for vulnerability detection.

- User asks "find user inputs" → write a **source-only** rule, list all input endpoints
- User asks "find SQL injection" → write a **source→sink** taint rule
- User asks "where does this value go" → write a **forward trace** (`-->`) rule
- User asks "what calls this function" → write a **call-site** rule

**NEVER** fall back to grep/rg for code analysis. Always use `ssa_compile` + `ssa_query` with SyntaxFlow. SyntaxFlow operates on SSA IR and understands cross-procedure data flow — grep cannot do this.

### Source-Only Query Examples (Java)

When the user asks about user inputs, HTTP endpoints, or controllable parameters:

```syntaxflow
// Find all Spring MVC controller handler methods
*Mapping.__ref__?{opcode: function} as $endpoints;
alert $endpoints;
```

```syntaxflow
// Find all user-controllable parameters in Spring controllers
*Mapping.__ref__?{opcode: function}<getFormalParams>?{opcode: param && !have: this} as $params;
alert $params;
```

```syntaxflow
// Find GetMapping vs PostMapping endpoints separately
GetMapping.__ref__?{opcode: function} as $getEndpoints;
PostMapping.__ref__?{opcode: function} as $postEndpoints;
alert $getEndpoints;
alert $postEndpoints;
```

### Source→Sink Query Examples (only when user asks for vulnerability detection)

```syntaxflow
// RCE: trace user input to exec()
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(* #-> * as $source) as $sink;
alert $sink for {title: "RCE", level: "high"};
```

## Proactive Security Insights

After running a query and finding results, **proactively** raise follow-up questions and suggestions. Do NOT just dump results and stop.

### When vulnerabilities are found:

1. **Suggest fix**: "This exec() call receives unsanitized user input. Consider using a whitelist or ProcessBuilder with explicit argument separation."
2. **Ask related questions**:
   - "Should I check if there are other endpoints that also call `Runtime.exec()`?"
   - "Want me to trace whether any input validation/sanitization exists between the source and sink?"
   - "Should I look for similar patterns in other controllers?"
3. **Cross-reference**: If one vulnerability type is found, proactively scan for related types:
   - Found RCE → "I also checked for SSRF and found 2 potential issues. Want details?"

### When no results are found:

1. Don't just say "no results" — explain WHY:
   - "No direct `exec()` calls found, but I see `ProcessBuilder` usage. Want me to check those instead?"
   - "The query matched 0 sinks. This could mean the code uses a framework abstraction — want me to search for framework-specific patterns?"
2. Suggest alternative queries

### When results are ambiguous:

1. Ask for clarification: "I found 8 data flow paths to `executeQuery()`, but 5 use parameterized queries (safe). Want me to filter to only the 3 using string concatenation?"

## Companion Reference Files

When writing SyntaxFlow rules, read these files using the `Read` tool for syntax help and real-world examples:

| File | When to Read | Path (relative to this file) |
|---|---|---|
| **NativeCall Reference** | When writing rules that need `<nativeCallName()>` functions — all 40+ NativeCall functions with syntax and examples | `nativecall-reference.md` |
| **SyntaxFlow Examples** | When writing new rules — 20+ production rules covering Java/Go/PHP/C, organized by vulnerability type | `syntaxflow-examples.md` |

**Workflow**: 
1. Read `syntaxflow-examples.md` to find a similar rule pattern
2. Need a NativeCall? Read `nativecall-reference.md`
3. Compose and execute via `ssa_query`

## SyntaxFlow Quick Reference

### Search & Match

```
documentBuilder          // variable name
.parse                   // method name (dot prefix)
documentBuilder.parse    // chain
*config*                 // glob pattern
/(get[A-Z].*)/           // regex pattern
```

### Function Call & Parameters

```
.exec()                           // match any call
.exec(* as $params)               // capture all params
.parse(*<slice(index=1)> as $a1)  // capture by index
```

### Data Flow Operators

| Operator | Direction | Use |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| `#>` | Up 1 level | Direct definition |
| `#->` | Up recursive | **Trace to origin** — "where does this COME FROM?" |
| `->` | Down 1 level | Direct usage |
| `-->` | Down recursive | **Trace to final usage** — "where does this GO TO?" |

```
.exec(* #-> * as $source)            // trace param origin
$userInput --> as $sinks              // trace where value goes
$sink #{depth: 5}-> as $source       // depth-limited trace
$val #{
  include: `*?{opcode: const}`
}-> as $constSources                  // filter during trace
$sink #{
  until: `* & $source`,              // stop when reaching source
}-> as $reachable
```

### Filters `?{...}`

```
$vals?{opcode: call}                // by opcode: call/const/param/phi/function/return
$vals?{have: 'password'}            // by string content
$vals?{!opcode: const}              // negation
$vals?{opcode: call && have: 'sql'} // combined
$factory?{!(.setFeature)}           // method NOT called on value
```

### Variable, Check & Alert

```
.exec() as $sink;                                      // assign
check $sink then "found" else "not found";             // assert
alert $sink for { title: "RCE", level: "high" };       // mark finding
$a + $b as $merged;                                    // union
$all - $safe as $vuln;                                 // difference
```

### NativeCall (40+ built-in functions)

Most commonly used — see `nativecall-reference.md` for full list:

```
<include('rule-name')>         // import lib rule
<typeName()>                   // get short type name
<fullTypeName()>               // get full qualified type name
<getReturns>                   // function return values
<getFormalParams>              // function parameters
<getFunc>                      // enclosing function
<getCall>                      // find call sites
<getCallee>                    // get called function
<getObject>                    // parent object
<getMembers>                   // object members
<name>                         // get name
<slice(index=N)>               // extract by index
<mybatisSink>                  // MyBatis SQL injection sinks
<dataflow(include=`...`)>      // filter data flow paths
```

## Tips

1. `#->` = "where does this come from?", `-->` = "where does this go?"
2. Use `*` for params, don't hardcode names
3. SSA resolves assignments: `a = getRuntime(); a.exec(cmd)` = `getRuntime().exec(cmd)`
4. Use `opcode` filters to distinguish constants / parameters / calls
5. Combine `check` + `alert` for actionable results
6. After code changes, use `base_program_name` (not `re_compile`) for fast incremental updates
7. Before writing a new rule, **read `syntaxflow-examples.md`** to find similar patterns
8. When unsure about a NativeCall, **read `nativecall-reference.md`** for usage and examples
